        The Ramayana (also spelt as Ramayan) is India’s eternal tale. It tells the story of the god-avatar Ram (also
        Rama) and his
        incredible adventurous journey to establish good over evil and defeat the arrogant, covetous, and selfish king
        Ravan (also Ravana).
        It is a story with deep allegorical meaning and profound lessons in morality. It is epic in scope and structure,
        and has been told in India
        for thousands of years. But, as this brilliant book shows, the Ramayana and Ram are part of the epic-making
        structure and ethical code across Asia and elsewhere.
        The story of Ram in many ways is a story that belongs to all peoples around the world, and this book details
        some of the most striking ways in which the story of Ram has been
        told and retold. Ram - A Global History establishes the story of Ram as a common thread of humanity around the
        world. Ram - A Global History marks the debut of a captivating young scholar with
        enormous promise. Ameya Pratap Singh was trained in international relations at St. Xavier’s College, Mumbai

        It is definitely not a retelling of Ramayan. The books and the series is based on Ramayan but is different from
        the version we have been listening
        to since childhood. Some of my relatives don't like the book as it doesn't adhere to Ramcharitmanas. But it's
        fiction. It's Ramayan seen from Amish's eyes
        . I really dont see anything wrong with it. In the depths of my heart I actually imagine
        that this was the true Ramayan. Because frankly, we youngsters today don't quite believe in miracles and shaaps
        and
        vardans ( no offense to those who do believe). And what we don't believe, we can't respect
