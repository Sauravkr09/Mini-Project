            <h3>Meet Dog</h3>
            <p>In the morning light, a furry ball of delight,
                Four paws scamper, chasing dreams in flight.
                With a wagging tail and eyes so bright,
                A loyal friend, a source of pure delight.
                Bounding through fields, a playful spree,
                Unconditional love, a bond so free.
                In moments of joy or by my side,
                A faithful companion, in whom I confide.
                Furry ears perk up at the slightest sound,
                In silence or laughter, always around.
                A canine confidant, through thick and thin,
                A treasure of joy, my heart's kin.</p>

            <h3>Meet monkey</h3>
            <p>Monkeys are highly intelligent mammals belonging to the primate order.
                They are known for their playful behavior and agile movements in trees.
                There are over 260 different species of monkeys, divided into two main groups: Old World monkeys and New
                World monkeys.
                Old World monkeys are found in Africa and Asia, while New World monkeys inhabit the Americas.
                Monkeys have a diverse diet, including fruits, leaves, insects, and small animals.
                Many monkey species live in social groups, known as troops, and display complex social structures.
                The capuchin monkey, known for its distinctive appearance, is often seen in movies and television shows.
                Monkeys use various vocalizations, facial expressions, and body language for communication within their
                groups.
                Some monkeys, like the spider monkey, have prehensile tails that help them grasp and swing from
                branches.
                Conservation efforts are crucial to protect monkeys and their habitats from threats like deforestation
                and illegal wildlife trade.</p>
